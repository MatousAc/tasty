This app definitely has some bugs. 

For instance, the description for the fruit pizza recipe is so long that it causes 
the div to overflow above the image.
This only happens sometimes (when the image is not of portrait height) and can cause 
a problem with clicking something above the box for the recipe preview.

Another "bug" is that you are supposed to be able to click the "Build New Meal" button again
and again and get a new combination each time, but since the selection is completely random,
it is possible to get the same combination of recipes a second time. It would be ideal to 
keep track of what recipes have already been displayed and not display them again. It probably 
wouldn't be difficult to implement, but I've got no more time to do that.

Other bugs may come up, but so far I haven't discovered them.
