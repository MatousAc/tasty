Hey Prof. O. or whoever is grading this. 
So i've got just a few minutes left to try to submit this . . . 
But here's some useful info hopefully.

Watch my tutorial on how this project works in the vidoe in the "notcode" file

Back End Code: in the ZIP file go to "tasty-api"
All my back end Ruby code is here. Most of my work was on the back end.
You don't have to do anything with the back end however as
my API is hosted on Heroku @ https://tastyapi.herokuapp.com/api/v1/

Front End Code: in the ZIP file go to "tasty-front"
To start my app, open the "recipes.html" file
You can naviate to all the other pages from there.

Nothing should be needed to be installed. Contact me if you have any trouble.

I give credit where credit is due in the "notecode\thanks.txt"
